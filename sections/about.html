    I'm a dedicated Full Stack Developer with 3+ years of experience building secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. I specialize in React.js, TypeScript, C#, .NET (ASP.NET Core, MVC, Blazor), Node.js, and SQL, with a strong front-end foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    Certified in Microsoft Azure (AZ-900, AZ-204) and Google Cloud, I bring cloud-native development skills and performance optimization to every project. I've contributed to enterprise-level platforms at companies like CGI and COPYL ABâ€”implementing robust backend APIs, role-based and attribute-based access control (RBAC/ABAC), and enhancing user experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m comfortable working across the stackâ€”from building modern UIs to designing APIs and managing databases. I thrive in Agile teams, collaborate effectively using tools like Git, Azure DevOps, and Jira, and am passionate about clean code, continuous learning, and delivering meaningful results through technology.
